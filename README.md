Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a modern approach to Data Analysis 
focusing on the topological features of data; it has been widely studied 
in recent years and used extensively in Biology, Physics, and many
other areas. However, financial markets have been studied slightly through
TDA. Here we present a quick review of some recent applications of TDA
on financial markets, including applications in the early detection of 
turbulence periods in financial markets and how TDA can help to get new
insights while investing. Also, we propose a new turbulence index based
on persistent homology — the fundamental tool for TDA — that seems
to capture critical transitions in financial data; we tested our index with
different financial time series (S&P500, Russel 2000, S&P/BMV IPC and
Nikkei 225) and crash events (Black Monday crash, dot-com crash, 2007-
08 crash and COVID-19 crash). Furthermore, we include an introduction
to persistent homology so the reader can understand this paper without
knowing TDA.
